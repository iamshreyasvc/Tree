# Tree


The tree is a multi-user social media platform that is meant specifically for academia, students, and professors. Where we can collaborate, share information, engage with job and research opportunities.


I mostly worked on the front end, gave and implemented suggestions for better user experience. Used Canva to front-end templates, while also narrating and scripting our video presentation.
